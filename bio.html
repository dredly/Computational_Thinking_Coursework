            <h1>Dave Smith - Engineer and Musician</h1>
            <p>
                Dave Smith, along with Ikaturo Kakehashi is credited with the creation of MIDI (Musical Instrument
                Digital
                Interface), which is still the standard today for communication between computers and all sorts of
                digital
                instruments. Dave Smith graduated from UC Berkeley with degrees in both Computer Science and Electrical
                Engineering. In 2013, 30 years after the initial creation of the MIDI standard, both creators were
                awarded a
                Technical Grammy.<sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a> ]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                The initial version of the MIDI standard was first introduced in 1983, with the cooperation of four
                major
                musical equipment manufacturers: Roland, Korg, Yamaha and Kawai, and was soon adopted almost universally
                by
                the
                industry.<sup>[<a href="#ref2">2</a> ]</sup> This was revolutionary, as it allowed any digital music
                device to interact with another,
                whereas
                before compatibility was far from guaranteed. The MIDI file format can be read and exported by most
                music
                software, including DAWs such as Ableton Live, as well as music notation software, like Musescore and
                Sibelius.

                <p>
                    Smith’s lifelong work and interest in music technology began in 1972, when he purchased a Minimoog
                    synth. He
                    was
                    however frustrated by the limitations of the technology at the time, as the synth could only play
                    one
                    note
                    at a
                    time and could not be programmed. He solved the latter of these problems by designing a 16 step
                    controller
                    to
                    program his Minimoog, which would later evolve into the Model 600 Sequencer.

                    Though MIDI is perhaps the most well known of Smith’s contributions, he was also responsible for
                    designing
                    the
                    Prophet-5, the world’s first fully-programmable polyphonic (capable of playing multiple sounds at
                    once)
                    analogue
                    synthesiser. He was working with microprocessors as his day job at the time, and found out that one
                    manufacturer, Solid State Music, was planning to release a new chipset featuring filters, envelopes
                    and
                    other
                    functionality which would be useful for music synthesis. This gave him the technology he needed to
                    make
                    the
                    Prophet-5, which was an almost immediate success.<sup>[<a href="#ref3">3</a> ]</sup>
