            <h1>Computational Thinking</h1>
            <p>
                Computational thinking could be considered useful in almost any field, but to become a developer it is
                absolutely crucial. Computers may be good at processing large amounts of data extremely fast, but they
                are not intelligent like humans. Therefore we must be extremely specific with our programming, and
                understand exactly what we are telling a computer to do, as it will follow instructions literally and
                sometimes lead to unexpected results.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recently read an article which reminded me of this, and which shows that even the much-acclaimed
                advanced machine learning and genetic algorithms we hear about are still just following a set of
                instructions, albeit very complex ones, without any thought. The author describes his time working for
                an AI startup, in which they used a game called <span class="italic"> Airships: Conquer the Skies</span>
                to test their new genetic
                algorithm. In the game, players first design an airship from given components, and then battle against
                other airships. The algorithm was given the simple instruction to defeat as many enemies as possible
                using the cheapest possible build. It settled on a strategy to complete this: building a tiny ship that
                would fire missiles point blank at other ships, only to destroy itself moments later. According to the
                given parameters, this was a winning strategy, but not applicable to the real world. The program was not
                explicitly told to factor in self preservation, so it did not.

                All this means that we must adapt our thinking to be more compatible with how computers work. For
                example, we should be aware that since computers inherently work in binary, there can be unexpected
                inaccuracies when dealing with floating point numbers. Random numbers can be another thing to look out
                for, as the default random number function of a language can often use a deterministic algorithm,
                meaning it would produce the same result if the initial conditions can be replicated. So while to human
                eyes the number could appear completely random, it would not be advised to use it as a security key in a
                program.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, an important concept that came up a lot in seminars for this module was scalability. Computers
                excel at doing large amounts of simple calculations, so we should take advantage of this whenever we
                can. Some methods of solving a problem work well at a small scale, but do not scale up efficiently. One
                example of this discussed in the course was the idea of making tea for one person vs making tea for a
                hundred. Brewing each cup separately with a single teabag would not be considered scalable in this
                instance.
            </p>
            <p>
                To conclude, computational thinking, with its core concepts of decomposition, abstraction, pattern
                recognition and algorithms, provides a useful framework for problem solving in all fields, but
                especially in my chosen field of computing. Ideas such as scalability and DRY (don’t repeat yourself)
                will be sure to help me in many future projects.
